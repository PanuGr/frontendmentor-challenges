## My process
For the background image, I set it up from my .css file as `background-image: url('image1'), url('image2')`.
For the main card, I divided it in a `header` with an img tag and the rest in a `section`. I position the image to the center with `translate()`.
The stats are a `ul` list displayed as flexbox. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS variables & nesting
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This has been the first time that i worked with svg. I didn't know much about that format. I also got the opportunity to work with positioning 2 background images at the same time.

### Continued development
I feel that svgs are something that I will have to learn and use again in the future.
