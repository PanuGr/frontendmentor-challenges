## My process
I started this project with the desktop design first. I am using grid layout and a bit of flexbox. 
To create the share-options element was challenging but eventually i got it to look as it should, and to be in the right place.
I wrote a javascript function that toggles the button and shows the share-options by applying some .css classes.
 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Scss
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Transitions
- Javascript
- Font Awesome

### What I learned
I had never before made a custom share-tooltip, so that was challenging and interesting. I also practiced transitions. 

### Continued development
Grid-layouts is something I should continue developing.
### Useful resources

- [Multiple contents in 1 grid-column](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43311943/prevent-content-from-expanding-grid-items) - I found a hack to fit 2 elements in the same grid column, without having it in a flexbox wrapper.
- [Grid layouts](https://1linelayouts.glitch.me/) - This is an amazing site with few layout snippets.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) - An icon library that I use in this project.
