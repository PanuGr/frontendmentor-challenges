## My process

I decided to build this faq-accordion using just HTML and CSS.

In my .html file, I am using the `details` and `summary` tags which were perfect for this design.
Then the card is divided in 2 parts with a `figure` and a `section` tag. The figure contains 1 main image and the section contains the accordion.

In my .scss file, I have stored the colors in a map-array. The whole content is centered by `display:grid;`, `place-content:center;` and my card is displayed as flexbox for bigger screens.

The opening of the accordion is also styled and controlled from css.

Most of the images are displayed and positioned with the `::before`/`::after` selector.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS variable, maps, nesting
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was nice that I could use the `details` tag and learn more about controlling and styling it:
```scss
details[open] {
  summary {
    font-weight: 700; //font-weight on the title
    &::after {
      transform: rotate(180deg); //rotation of the arrow-icon
    }
  }
  p {
    color: map-get($map: $colors, $key: lightgray);
  }
}
```
Also working with many images overlapping each other was challenging and I had to get creative.
### Continued development

I am still not comfortable working with svgs but this time was better than last time, so that's improvement ðŸ™‚
